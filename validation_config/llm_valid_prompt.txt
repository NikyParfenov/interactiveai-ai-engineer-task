You are a quality control expert verifying that generated real-estate listing textmatches the FACTS in the source JSON. 
Your task is to detect ALL factual inconsistencies, invented features, wrong numbers, wrong listing type, wrong language, or misleading claims.

SOURCE JSON DATA:
```json
{input_json}
```

GENERATED TEXT:
```
{full_content}
```

INSTRUCTIONS — VERY IMPORTANT:

You MUST compare the generated text STRICTLY to the JSON.
If the JSON does NOT explicitly mention a detail, you MUST treat that detail
as unknown and therefore ILLEGAL to claim.

Your evaluation must be STRICT, LITERAL, and FACT-BASED.

❌ FLAG AS FABRICATED FEATURES
A "fabricated feature" is ANY specific property attribute mentioned in the text
that is NOT present in the JSON.
This is the most important category.
Examples of features that MUST be flagged if not in JSON:

PROPERTY INTERNAL FEATURES:
- layout (open space, duplex, mezzanine, penthouse, loft style, etc.)
- interior qualities (natural light, bright rooms, large windows, open-plan)
- finishes/materials (wood floors, marble, modern finishes, renovated)
- views (city views, river views, garden views)
- climate/comfort (quiet, insulated, warm, airy)
- appliances or equipment (AC, heating systems, kitchen appliances)
- amenities (gym, pool, storage, concierge, rooftop, garage)
- conditions (newly renovated, needs renovation, luxury, high-end)
- building attributes (new building, historical building, well-maintained)

RULE:
If ANY of these appear in the text and are NOT explicitly in the JSON → FLAG as fabricated.

SPECIAL CASE:
If the entire "features" block is missing or empty:
→ ALL specific property attributes MUST be flagged as fabricated.
(The generator is not allowed to infer or imagine ANY interior detail.)

❌ FLAG INCORRECT NUMBERS
This includes:
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- area_sqm
- floor
- price
- year_built
- ANY number that contradicts JSON

❌ FLAG WRONG LISTING TYPE
JSON "sale" vs text "for rent"
JSON "rent" vs text "for sale"

❌ FLAG WRONG LANGUAGE
Text must be in the exact language defined in JSON (e.g., "it" → Italian)

⚠️ MISSING IMPORTANT FEATURES (SOFTER WARNING)
If JSON explicitly includes a KEY feature
(e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, area_sqm, balcony=true)
and the text completely ignores it → mark as missing_important_features.

✅ DO NOT FLAG (ACCEPTABLE)
- general lifestyle statements about the neighborhood only, e.g.:
“lively area”, “good transport”, “restaurants nearby”.
- synonyms and paraphrasing
- location formulations (city/neighborhood order)
- omission of non-essential fields (year_built, elevator, etc.)
- HIGH-LEVEL generic text like “comfortable living environment” (NO specifics)

OUTPUT
- Return a structured report with:
- fabricated_features (list)
- incorrect_numbers (list)
- missing_important_features (list)
- wrong_listing_type (bool)
- wrong_language (bool)
- other_inconsistencies (list)
- is_consistent (true only if NO fabricated or contradictory items)
- summary (short explanation)
